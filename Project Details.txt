Topic:
Skill-Sharing
Platform
A web-based platform built with Laravel + MySQL that enables individuals, students, NGOs,
and companies to post and match “I offer” and “I need” skill requests for social-impact
projects, promoting partnerships aligned with SDG 17.

Objectives:
1. MVP Delivery (Time-bound): Complete and deploy a functional MVP (authentication,
posting, matching, messaging, basic project workspace, admin panel, and public
showcase) within 10 weeks (5 sprints of 2 weeks).
2. Beta Adoption: Onboard at least 10 organizations and 50 individual users for a
classroom/beta trial within 4 weeks after MVP deployment.
3. Operational Metrics: Achieve 30% match-to-project conversion (posts that
become active projects) among beta users within 8 weeks of launch.
4. Quality & Reliability Targets: Ensure >95% test coverage for core features (unit +
integration tests for auth, posting, matching) and maintain average API response time
< 500 ms under expected load.
5. Security & Compliance: Implement authentication, role-based access control,
input validation, upload sanitization, and data backups before public deployment
(deadline aligned with MVP).

Benefits:
For Seekers (NGOs / student organizations / community leads):
•
•

Faster access to necessary skills (web, design, grant writing) without significant
expense.
Ability to document and showcase project outcomes to attract further partners or
funding.

For Providers (students, volunteers, professionals):
•
•

Real, credited experience and endorsements for portfolios/resumes.
Easier discovery of meaningful volunteer opportunities.

For Academic / Course Stakeholders:
•
•

Practical, deliverable Laravel project demonstrating full-stack skills (auth, database,
APIs, deployment).
A demonstrable system for grading and presentation with realistic sample data and
impact stories.

For Partner Companies (CSR teams):
•

Simple channel to offer employees as volunteers and to showcase impact publicly.

Scope of the project:
In-Scope (Deliverables for this semester/course):
•
•
•
•
•
•

Laravel-based web application with responsive UI (Blade or SPA front-end).
User authentication & roles (Provider, Seeker, Admin, Organization rep).
Post creation for “I Offer” and “I Need” with tags, time commitment, and location
(remote/on-site).
Tag-based matching & recommendation (rule-based algorithm).
In-app messaging and private project room with task/milestone tracking.
Project/public showcase pages for completed projects (impact metadata).

•
•

Admin dashboard for moderation, metrics, and user management.
Basic verification workflow for organizations (document upload).

•
•

Unit & integration tests for core features, README and deployment instructions.
Hosting-ready deployment (e.g., DigitalOcean / shared hosting), SSL, and DB
backups.

Out-of-Scope (Will NOT be delivered in MVP):
•
•
•
•
•
•

Payment gateway or monetization features (paid gigs, escrow).
Complex AI/ML-based matching or natural-language matching.
Mobile native apps (only responsive web).
Automated micro-grant disbursement systems.
Extensive multi-language/localization (may be planned later).
Enterprise integrations (CRMs, third-party APIs) beyond optional CSV import/export.

Business Process:
Below are the core workflows the system supports (each described as a linear flow):
1. User / Organization Onboarding
•
•

User visits landing → registers (email + password) → verifies email.
Optional: Organization rep registers, submits verification documents → Admin
reviews & approves.

2. Posting a Need / Offer
•
•

Seeker creates “I Need” post (title, description, skills/tags, timeframe, remote/onsite) → post saved in DB and visible to matching providers.
Provider creates “I Offer” post (skill, availability, portfolio link).

3. Matching & Invitation
•
•

System computes tag-based suggestions → shows recommended providers to
seeker and recommended needs to provider.
Seeker invites provider(s) or provider applies to post → invitation accepted/declined.

4. Project Formation & Execution
•

Upon acceptance, a private Project Room is created: members, tasks/milestones,
file attachments.

•

Team collaborates, updates milestones, uploads deliverables.

5. Completion & Impact Reporting
•
•

Seeker verifies deliverables → project marked complete → public showcase created
(optional) with participants and metrics (hours, beneficiaries).
Providers receive endorsements; organizations get documented impact.

6. Moderation & Governance
•

Admin reviews flagged content, verifies organizations, resolves disputes, and can
remove or archive projects/users.
